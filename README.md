# ESP32 GPIO Manipulation with Firebase Realtime Database

Welcome to the ESP32 project for manipulating and reading GPIO pins, powered by Firebase Realtime Database. This project enables real-time control and monitoring of GPIO pins on an ESP32 microcontroller through a cloud-based interface.

## Overview

This project is designed around the ESP32 microcontroller and utilizes the Firebase Realtime Database for seamless and efficient storage and retrieval of JSON data. With this setup, you can easily manipulate GPIO pins (e.g., turning LEDs on/off, reading sensor data) and monitor their states remotely.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Synchronization**: The project leverages Firebase Realtime Database to store and fetch JSON data, ensuring instant updates and synchronization across devices.
- **GPIO Control**: Control various GPIO pins on the ESP32, such as toggling LEDs, relays, or other peripherals.
- **GPIO Monitoring**: Read the state of GPIO pins, including digital and analog inputs, and push the data to Firebase for remote monitoring.

## How It Works

1. **Firebase Integration**: The ESP32 connects to Firebase and syncs GPIO pin states with the database. Commands sent from Firebase are executed by the ESP32 to control the pins.
2. **JSON Data Handling**: The project uses JSON format to structure the data stored in Firebase, making it easy to manage and expand with additional functionality.
3. **Remote Access**: The integration with Firebase allows for remote access and control, enabling you to manage the ESP32 GPIO pins from anywhere with internet connectivity.
